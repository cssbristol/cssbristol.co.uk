- Our theme this year is SPACE! 🌌🚀

The prizes will be awarded in three categories:

### Space data
Find a cool way to use satellite imagery or other data collected in space.

### Software/hardware for space
Build something that we could send into space!

### Explore space
Help non-scientists to explore and learn about space.

Here are some example projects to get your brains whirring:

-- NEO Mapper

Identifying natural boundaries (rivers) from 3D asteroid surface data

-- Kid On The Moon

Interactive app for children to explore the moon and man’s journeys to it
https://2016.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/solar-system/book-it-to-the-moon/projects/kid-on-the-moon

-- NatEv Explorer

Display crowdsourced natural events on a 3D globe
https://open.nasa.gov/innovation-space/natev-explorer/

-- FractalNet

P2P wearables for communication in space
https://2016.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/space-station/rock-it-space-fashion-and-design/projects/fractalnet

-- Pollen Alert

Use open data and satellite imagery to predict pollen count
https://2017.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/our-ecological-neighborhood/trace-invaders/teams/lemon-py-1/project

-- Heliox

Use energy and solar radiation data to predict energy production
https://2017.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/earth-and-us/you-are-my-sunshine/teams/heliox/project

Maybe you'll write a piece of software that will improve shipping efficiency. How about a system for monitoring air pollution? Or something that will enable autonomous vehicles? Perhaps you'll even write a cool visualisation that uses NASA's Open Data platform (https://opensource.gsfc.nasa.gov/ ).

If you want to make use of satellite data, we'll be releasing some guides to help you soon.

// TOOLS AVAILABLE //

- TBC for now

// GOOD LUCK! //
