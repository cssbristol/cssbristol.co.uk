Philip Adler, visiting from Visa, will speak about the skills which are important to being a good software engineer, how conceptual understanding best aids software engineering in large companies like Visa, and the kinds of approaches that aid software engineers in their day to-day.

This promises to be another useful and interesting talk; please tap GOING so that we buy enough 🍕🥙!
