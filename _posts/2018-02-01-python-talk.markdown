Join us for the first talk/workshop of the year as we explore the best bits of Python! The talk will be taken by Lewis, a fellow CompSci here at Bristol.

Let us know if you're coming, we've got pizza to order!

"Python is more than just a programming language, it's a whole development mindset and ecosystem that offers many advantages to over competing workflows in many situations. Build quickly, run on many platforms and actually enjoy yourself doing it! Join python developer Lewis Bell as he takes you through a whistle-stop tour of the basics of the language, leaving you with a strong foundation for your future in Python Development."
