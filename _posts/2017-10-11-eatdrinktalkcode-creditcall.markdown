[Creditcall](http://www.creditcall.com/) will be hosting a social very close to the MVB immediately after the careers fair on October 19 - exact location soon to be confirmed.

Here’s your chance to mingle with like-minded students and experienced developers alike to share ideas and insights on all things code in central Bristol over a few drinks and some grub.

Who is Creditcall?

Developers worldwide use our SDKs in their own solutions to enable them to accept payments. We connect mobiles, websites, stores, parking and train station ticketing machines with a bank to process debit or credit card payments quickly, reliably, & securely.
