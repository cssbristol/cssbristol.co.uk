Come along to 1.11A MVB on the 24th October for coding, prizes and food - and a chance to chat with one of our great sponsors G-Research!

-----------

G-Research is a leading quantitative research and technology company. We apply scientific techniques to find patterns in large, noisy and real-world data sets, using the latest statistical and "big data" analysis methodologies to predict global financial markets.

Please join us for our annual coding challenge where you will compete in teams in a series of progressively more difficult sentiment analysis challenges. This is a great chance to test your problem solving and coding skills and a chance to win a £50 Amazon vouchers per team member (plus prizes for runners up!)

To take part all you need is at least one laptop per team and have a development environment set up for C#, Java or Python and you must be able to provide your own internet access.

Afterwards we will provide food and drinks and a chance for you to talk to our employees informally about internships, graduate roles and life at G-Research!

To register your interest please email graduates@gresearch.co.uk. You can register alone or as part of a team of up to 4 members, if you register individually you will be allocated a team at the event.
