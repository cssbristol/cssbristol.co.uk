We have an engineer from Bloomberg coming to talk to us about how the JVM executes Java.

When Java was released in 1995 it was slow, a reputation it has carried for many years. Today, Java can give performance that is comparable to C++ and can emit instructions that are more optimal than code which is statically compiled. But how?

This talk will take a tour from Java code and look at the journey it takes through the JVM and the optimisations in between. Using practical examples, JVM flags and the Open Source JIT Watch we will explore what the JVM in an adaptation of the classic Hello World program, you'll never look at Java in the same way again.

Topics include:

* Profile Guided Optimisation
* JIT Compilation
* Method Inlining
* Dead Code Elimination
* Register Allocation
* Escape Analysis
* Loop Unrolling
* Monomorphic Dispatch
* On Stack Replacement
