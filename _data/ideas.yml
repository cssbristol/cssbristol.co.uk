- name: Reorganise faculty/school website to be task-oriented for students
  description: >
      At the moment, the Faculty website is mostly organised around external marketing.
      It's hard to perform common tasks such as booking rooms, finding course reps,
      looking at marking regulations etc. Some of these are available in Venturers' Voice,
      but this is hard to find and somewhat ad-hoc.
