Here at ACCIS (Advanced Composites Centre for Innovation and Science), we are looking for an enthusiastic Software Engineering Intern with a good experience in building a web-based Graphical User Interface (GUI) for an available Matlab code (m-file). After getting the inputs, the Matlab code produces some graphs and figures (stress-strain curves and Damage Mode Maps) to design optimal hybrid composites. The intention is to make this code and functionality available on the web so everyone can use this method easily and get the final results easily. The GUI will run on a Web browser, e.g. Chrome and Firefox and after getting the input values (numbers), it should display the results in a picture format. The user should be able to save the pictures in a high quality format.

The outcome of the work will be put up on the [HiPerDuCT website](http://www.hiperduct.ac.uk) which is under construction now.

If you are interested, please contact Dr Meisam Jalalvand, [m.jalalvand@bristol.ac.uk](mailto:m.jalalvand@bristol.ac.uk), explaining one similar work you have done before.
