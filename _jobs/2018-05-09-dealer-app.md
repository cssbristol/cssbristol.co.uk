Calling all developers with a big heart, who want to join a small team trying to make a difference.

The Dealer App team are aiming to deliver a new type of discounting platform. We connect restaurants with hungry individuals and then attempt to use those discounts to raise money for local homeless charities. The idea is to save & give.

It is a winner for restaurants as they can sell spare seats in real time and eliminate spare capacity. A winner for all our users who get to save money and a winner for our charities who get a hand with their fundraising.
