  Overview

  Generally speaking, organisations bring in consultants when they need objective, expert advice on how to change their business for the better. That advice could cover virtually any aspect of their business: their people, their strategy, their finance, their supply chain anything. Some consultancies are good at coming up with ideas. Others are skilled at implementing them. Here, our team is proud to do both. So as an Industrial Placement student, you’ll find you can influence business strategies and deliver lasting change to companies, from the biggest global organisations to the most innovative new enterprises.

  We currently have Industrial Placement opportunities in our Service Operations area. Service Operations works with major Financial Services clients to improve profitability and business productivity through process simplification, operating cost reduction, and service improvement. We focus on the full front-to-back value chain (including front office), as well as supporting business functions such as operations, risk, technology and finance to improve the quality of service delivery.

  What you'll be doing

  Industrial Placement students will be integrated into our project teams, working to solve complex business problems for our clients. You can expect to be involved in:

  *  Working within a team on client facing projects or programme work streams
  *  Producing exceptional deliverables for clients
  *  Understanding and gathering client and business requirements
  *  Supporting effective day to day client relationships

  The scheme will include an induction equipping you with the skills needed for a successful placement; you will have a strong support network and be given graduate level responsibility. This placement is an opportunity to find out what life at Deloitte is really like, in and out of working hours.
