[Myrtle](https://myrtlesoftware.com) is looking for multiple skilled Haskell developers to join our growing development team writing a compiler for generating highly efficient hardware designs implementing machine learning solutions.

We use Haskell for every aspect of our work and developers will get the chance to be involved in every part of the project. As an example, some things we’ve worked on recently are a tiny CPU to implement a custom network protocol to communicate between a PC and an FPGA and a Haskell implementation of part of the Caffe deep learning framework.

Specific tasks you could be working on soon include:

- Implementing fixed point neural network evaluation support in our compiler
- Supporting AWS F1 instances as a backend
- Investigating and implementing exciting techniques for neural network evaluation such as the Winograd small convolution algorithm and realising full hardware implementations of existing neural networks.

A familiarity and interest with hardware design would be viewed positively but is not essential. Applicants should be familiar with Unix based systems; all our development is done on Ubuntu or NixOS.
