Combining data, research, technology and trading expertise has shaped QRT’s collaborative mindset which enables us to solve the most complex challenges. QRT’s culture of innovation continuously drives our ambition to deliver high quality returns for our investors.

We are looking to add motivated, intellectually curious penultimate year STEM students or upcoming graduates with entrepreneurial spirit to join our Data Development group for a 12-week summer internship.

## The Opportunity
We are proud of our exceptionally talented, collaborative and diverse teams who are driving QRT’s innovation and growth, and are looking to add motivated, intellectually curious STEM graduates with entrepreneurial spirit to join our Infrastructure and Cloud Engineering groups. We strongly believe that long-term investment into our people is critical to our future success and distinctive culture, as demonstrated by our low staff turnover and continuous growth.

The Infrastructure Engineering and Cloud Engineering teams are fundamental to QRT, underpinning our research, trading and support systems globally. Our Infrastructure Engineering team is responsible for developing, designing and implementing server and network infrastructure, including continually evaluating new low latency and performance techniques for ultra-low latency trading. Our Cloud Engineering team scale and operate the majority of QRTs research technology trading stack using AWS and related cloud technologies with automation and infrastructure as code at the heart of their success.

As a graduate in our Infrastructure and Cloud Engineer group, you will join and rotate through a number of different teams within our Technology function, gaining unique insights into our cutting-edge trading systems across the full stack. Working closely with a range of people from across the business globally, including QRT’s Researchers & Traders, Technology teams and other groups within QRT, giving you an unparalleled opportunity to learn and drive meaningful change.

You will be given continuous, hands-on training and mentorship from an experienced QRT colleague and the wider business throughout your career, helping you to learn technologies unique to the financial sector, soft skills and best practices within professional software, cloud and hardware engineering. We will demystify the world of systematic trading, explaining the core components of a global trading system – previous finance experience is not required! You will receive practical experience of QRTs infrastructure and cloud ecosystems and will work on system source code in various areas of the stack.

 
## Technologies and Projects
Based on your skills, interests and the groups project pipeline, you will be assigned real-world, impactful projects and given full ownership of them.

Projects across our Infrastructure and Cloud group can span anything across our high performance, cross asset trading and research systems. For example:
- Intel CPU tuning deep dives including overclocking L3 cache configuration, or performance testing production code.
- Deploying Jupyter Notebook Python research/development environments at scale using Apache Spark, Hadoop, clustering, AWS, etc.
- Testing and benchmarking new bleeding edge tech in our performance lab, with the view of releasing new technology into production that has a genuinely positive and measurable impact to the business.
- Building and supporting the tooling to allow our developers to spin up hundreds or thousands of CPU cores for their research on an as-needed basis.
 

**Technologies you could work with include:** Linux, RedHat, Python/C++ development, FPGA’s, Solarflare, git, Bash, SQL, Networks, AWS Cloud Computing, Network protocols, techniques and technologies, Terraform, Ansible, Apache Spark, Hadoop, as well as all of our internal software engineering tools.

We value motivated, curious engineers who can influence and change our development environments and controls, making improvement suggestions to the development team. You will be challenged to find ways to improve functionality and performance, and are invited and encouraged to teach us any new techniques you discover in the process!
