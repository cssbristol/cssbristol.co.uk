[Apply now](https://www.epimorphics.com/summer-internships-2017/)

Are you a student or junior developer who would like to join Epimorphics for the summer? We are looking for two or three interns to join us to work on some of the cool project ideas that we don’t have time to do ourselves at the moment! These positions would ideally suit undergraduate students, but are open to any junior developers who have some programming experience.
About you

## Projects

The precise details of the project you would be working on will be finalized when you start your project, and there will be some opportunity for you to shape the direction of the project. Typical themes will include:

- strengthening our suite of internal infrastructure tools, which help us keep our projects and client deliverables running smoothly
- building open-source demos or data-visualisations to show off some of the linked-data datasets that we work with
- creating open-source libraries and tools to help other developers more easily make use of the open-data that we help our customers to publish

## About you

You’ll be writing software, so you’ll need to be familiar with at least one programming language, and excited about the idea of learning new languages, libraries or technologies. We mostly work in JavaScript, Ruby and Java, so familiarity with any of those languages would be an advantage. For web development, you’d also need to know at least some HTML5 and CSS.

We work on projects in teams, so being able to describe at least one project you’ve worked on would be helpful, especially if you’ve used an agile approach, or used tools such as git and Trello to coordinate the activities on the project.
What to expect

## What to expect

We help our clients create and use open linked-data, so you can expect to learn about linked-data technologies, including RDF, OWL and SPARQL. Depending on the project, you can expect to gain experience in application development or data visualization, and make some visible contributions to open-source software. Each intern will have a mentor from the company who will guide them and the project over the duration of the internship.
About the position

## About the position

We’d like you to have time to make a solid contribution to our work, so this position is expected to last for three months over the summer. Our 2016 intern joined us a few days after his university summer term ended, and finished in time to take some vacation before starting the new term.
