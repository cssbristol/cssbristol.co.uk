## About QRT
Qube Research & Technologies (QRT) is a global quantitative and systematic investment manager, operating in all liquid asset classes across the world. We are a technology and data driven group implementing a scientific approach to investing. Combining data, research, technology and trading expertise has shaped QRT’s collaborative mindset which enables us to solve the most complex challenges. QRT’s culture of innovation continuously drives our ambition to deliver high quality returns for our investors.

We are looking to add motivated, intellectually curious STEM students with entrepreneurial spirit to join and rotate through our Software Development groups for 4, 6 or 12 months (based on your skills and interests, and dependent on course & university).

## The Opportunity
The Software Development group is fundamental to QRT – our advanced technology platforms have been deployed to cover all geographies and asset classes globally. Working closely with a range of people from across the business globally, including QRT’s Researchers & Traders, Technology teams and other groups within QRT, giving you an unparalleled opportunity to learn and drive meaningful change.

You will be given continuous, hands-on training and mentorship from an experienced QRT colleague and the wider business throughout your time at QRT, helping you to learn technologies unique to the financial sector, soft skills and best practices within professional software engineering. We will demystify the world of systematic trading, explaining the core components of a global trading system and how system architecture designs are implemented – previous finance experience is not required! You will receive practical experience within the trading systems environment across the stack: from front to back, hardware to software.

Our goal is to give you a real sense of what it’s like to work at QRT and the sorts of problems you would solve. Successfully completing our industrial placement programme is a fast-track way of securing a return place at QRT as a full-time graduate software engineer.

## Team Responsibilities:

- Building out new large-scale data visualisation platforms and tools in Python using modern web tools and new data science concepts.
- Expanding and re-writing our GUI stack to incorporate new technologies
- Building out strategic new parts of our platforms using C#/C++/Python and various other technologies like a new risk engine that computes huge volumes of data in real time, and everything else in between.
- Exposure to the following technologies: C/C++/C#/Python/React development, distributed systems, FPGA’s, Linux, Windows, AWS etc. as well as all of our internal software engineering tools.

 

## What we are looking for:
