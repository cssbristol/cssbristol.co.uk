This is a part-time (casual) role for current University of Bristol students.

Student Laptop and Mobile Clinic Technicians provide support to students in person at Student Laptop and Mobile Clinics. Staff must have excellent technical and problem solving abilities as well as good communication and customer service skills.

The majority of the work will be available during term-time throughout the year working on the Student Laptop and Mobile Clinics, fixing software and configuration problems with laptops, (mostly Windows and Mac OSX) or mobile devices, (mostly iOS, Android and Windows). Typically you will be connecting people to eduroam, removing viruses, restoring corrupt operating systems and advising students on how to look after their devices. You are likely to work one or two 3-hour shifts each week and these can be fitted around your academic timetable. There may be additional work carrying out basic computer or audiovisual maintenance, again at times when you are free. Staff are paid at an hourly rate on the basis of timesheets completed once a month.

## Why work for IT Services?

Each year a large number of current students join the team which run the Student Laptop and Mobile Clinic and help other students with IT problems on their laptops, tablets and smartphones. A job with IT Services offers competitive pay and excellent experience whilst working with, and helping other, Bristol students. It can be hard work but it is enjoyable, a chance to develop your technical, interpersonal and professional skills, and great experience for future employers.

Jobs start in September, during our busy period supporting new students at the start of the Autumn term. After that you would be working in the Clinic for a few hours per week during term time for the rest of the 2017/18 academic year, fixing software and configuration faults and advising on hardware repair options.

It is a job suitable for students who have an interest in computers and like to help others and fix faults. You do not need to be a Computer Scientist, only about half of our staff come from Computer Science courses and the rest from across the University.
