**Open to penultimate year STEM students or upcoming graduates.**

## Application deadline
**QRT recruits interns on a rolling basis. Apply early to maximise your chances of success!**

## About QRT
Qube Research & Technologies (QRT) is a global quantitative and systematic investment manager, operating in all liquid asset classes across the world. We are a technology and data driven group implementing a scientific approach to investing. Combining data, research, technology and trading expertise has shaped QRT’s collaborative mindset which enables us to solve the most complex challenges. QRT’s culture of innovation continuously drives our ambition to deliver high quality returns for our investors.

We are looking to add motivated, intellectually curious penultimate year STEM students or upcoming graduates with entrepreneurial spirit to join our Data Development group for a 12-week summer internship.

## The Opportunity
The Infrastructure Engineering and Cloud Engineering teams are fundamental to QRT, underpinning our research, trading and support systems globally. You will join a specific team aligned to your skills and interests. Our Infrastructure Engineering team is responsible for developing, designing and implementing server and network infrastructure, including continually evaluating new low latency and performance techniques for ultra-low latency trading. Our Cloud Engineering team scale and operate the majority of QRTs research technology trading stack using AWS and related cloud technologies with automation and infrastructure as code at the heart of their success.

You will be given continuous, hands-on training and mentorship from an experienced QRT colleague and the wider business throughout your time with QRT, helping you to learn technologies unique to the financial sector, soft skills and best practices within professional software, cloud and hardware engineering. We will demystify the world of systematic trading, explaining the core components of a global trading system – previous finance experience is not required! You will receive practical experience of QRTs infrastructure and cloud ecosystems and will work on system source code in various areas of the stack.

Our goal is to give you a real sense of what it’s like to work at QRT and the sorts of problems you would solve. Successfully completing our internship programme is a fast-track way of securing a return place at QRT as a full-time graduate engineer.


## Team Responsibilities:
Working across our Infrastructure and Cloud group can span a multitude of areas including:
- Intel CPU tuning deep dives including overclocking L3 cache configuration, or performance testing production code.
- Deploying Jupyter Notebook Python research/development environments at scale using Apache Spark, Hadoop, clustering, AWS, etc.
- Testing and benchmarking new bleeding edge tech in our performance lab, with the view of releasing new technology into production that has a genuinely positive and measurable impact to the business.
- Building and supporting the tooling to allow our developers to spin up hundreds or thousands of CPU cores for their research on an as-needed basis.
- Exposure to the following technologies: Linux, RedHat, Python/C++ development, FPGA’s, Solarflare, git, Bash, SQL, Networks, AWS Cloud Computing, Network protocols, techniques and technologies, Terraform, Ansible, Apache Spark, Hadoop, as well as all of our internal software engineering tools.
 

## What we are looking for:
- Strong penultimate year students or upcoming graduates studying for a degree (Bachelor’s, Master’s or PhD) in any STEM subject (computer science, physics, mathematics or any related engineering discipline) on track towards obtaining a 2:1 or above.
- Demonstrable passion for technology! Regardless of whether you have formal CompSci training or not – we are more interested in your achievements related to software/data engineering. For example - hobbies, past-time, open source or academic projects, etc. covering the following:
  - Scripting languages e.g. Python or Bash or another programming language.
  - Tools like GIT, SQL, gcc.
  - Linux command-line (Redhat/CentOS).
