Qube Research & Technologies (QRT) is a global quantitative and systematic investment manager, operating in all liquid asset classes across the world. We are a technology and data driven group implementing a scientific approach to investing. Combining data, research, technology and trading expertise has shaped QRT’s collaborative mindset which enables us to solve the most complex challenges. QRT’s culture of innovation continuously drives our ambition to deliver high quality returns for our investors.

**Open to penultimate year STEM students.**

**Technology Track:** Data Engineering and Analytics

**Location:** London (Victoria)

We are looking to add motivated, intellectually curious STEM students with entrepreneurial spirit to join and rotate through our Software Development groups for 4, 6 or 12 months (based on your skills and interests, and dependent on course & university).

## The Opportunity
The Data group is fundamental to QRT – data is at the source of everything we do! Our Data team is responsible for architecting and developing the next generation of our data platform which provides capacity to onboard and analyse structured and unstructured data from tick to tick to multi-year horizons.

You will be given continuous, hands-on training and mentorship from an experienced QRT colleague and the wider business throughout your time with QRT, helping you to learn technologies unique to the financial sector, soft skills and best practices within professional software and data engineering. We will demystify the world of systematic trading, explaining the core components of a global trading system – previous finance experience is not required! You will receive practical experience on building and scaling reliable data services with a focus on data quality and reliability.

Our goal is to give you a real sense of what it’s like to work at QRT and the sorts of problems you would solve. Successfully completing our industrial placement programme is a fast-track way of securing a return place at QRT as a full-time graduate engineer.

## Team Responsibilities:

- Researching various cutting-edge big data technologies available in the market and building proof of concepts to potentially bring them into the QRT data platform.
- Utilising modern Python to build a reliable and scalable data processing platform.
- Creating performant ETL processes to ingest new research data.
- Increasing throughput of existing systems to allow us to consume even larger volumes of data.
- Understanding how teams use data to optimise the data process across the QRT Data store.
- Exposure to the following technologies: Python/C# development, Big Data technologies, distributed systems, ETL, data storage, as well as all of our internal data and software engineering tools.

 

## What we are looking for:
- Strong penultimate year students or upcoming graduates studying for a degree (Bachelor’s, Master’s or PhD) in any STEM subject (computer science, physics, mathematics or any related engineering discipline) on track towards obtaining a 2:1 or above.
- Demonstrable passion for technology! Regardless of whether you have formal CompSci training or not – we are more interested in your achievements related to software/data engineering. For example - hobbies, past-time, open source or academic projects, etc. covering the following:
- Software Development, ideally with one of: Python, C# or C++.
- Structured or unstructured data management tools or techniques.
- SQL, NoSQL, distributed file systems.
- Linux platform.
- Pro-active and unafraid to ask questions. You can really have a huge impact here, improving our performance with suggestions and optimisations.
- Entrepreneurial approach and self-motivated.
 

## Why should you apply?
