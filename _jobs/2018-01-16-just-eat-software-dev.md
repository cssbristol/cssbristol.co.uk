“The Just Eat Bristol office provides a great balance between work and play, with a fantastic culture that encourages innovation, with many opportunities for graduates to develop, and individuals who not only contribute to the Just Eat community, but also do a great deal for the developing tech scene in Bristol as a whole. In the past year that I’ve been here, I’ve been involved in many cool projects such as ‘Favourite Products on menu’, the iOS app rebrand, and building restaurant recommendation algorithms. I was pleasantly surprised by how quickly graduates were trusted with the responsibility of delivering features. Seeing the direct impact that projects I’ve worked on has had on customers, such as generating thousands of ratings for the iOS app through a new app rating prompt (and getting it to No. 1 in the Food & Drink category in the App Store!), has been very rewarding and I look forward to working on other impactful projects in the future!” - Berk Mollamustafaoglu, Graduate Software Engineer
