J O B  C O N T E X T

Squarespace is the fastest growing web platform in the world. Over 1.1 million people have built a site with Squarespace, and many of them want more features and designs than the platform offers. We are SquareStudio, and we supercharge Squarespace websites. We create code snippets that allows Squarespace users to add cool features, functions & design elements to their sites. We’re 2 years old and have great traction in our market space. We have 10,000 customers and 150 products.

T H E   C O M P A N Y

Currently, SquareStudio consists of 2 in-house full-timers, and 8 developers who work remotely. We are supported by Natwest and KPMG through their Entrepreneurial Spark program. We have recently moved into our new office in Paintworks, Bristol.

T H E   R O L E

We are looking for an easy-going, skilled and flexible freelance front-end developer to handle some of the support requests that we receive from users looking for help with the code in their products. Sometimes this can be down to user error, but often it is because we are continually refining our products and some of the code needs to be tweaked to work better with their website, or just to work better in general!
