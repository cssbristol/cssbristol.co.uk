Founded in 1996 with offices in Bristol and New York, our payment technology powers millions of customers worldwide, ensuring they can take payments worth billions, securely and reliably.

You've probably used our software when ordering a burger, paying for parking or booking a train ticket - without realising it! If you want to join a team of industry leading experts, are passionate, talented, and ambitious and want to drive the continued development, we want to hear from you!

Due to continuous growth, we are looking for a certification analyst with a high level of motivation and attention to detail to join our Payment Solutions Team. The Payment Solutions Team is responsible for our processor and acquirer integrations providing real time transaction connectivity for customers worldwide. It’s important that these integrations go through certification, with associated payment terminals, in order to meet the strict standards criteria required by Visa, Mastercard, American Express and other card schemes. This is called EMV Level 3 certification.

## What will I be doing?

The majority of this role will be concerned with the certification of payment terminals and the associated integrations into financial institutions (acquirers and processors).

Key areas will be:

- Taking requirements provided by the sales channel and ensuring that the terminals are capable of meeting them.
- Communicating with financial institutions in order to request projects with appropriate justifications and clarifications.
- Understanding and executing test scripts provided by the card schemes for contact and contactless cards.
- Collating test results and returning them to financial institutions for their analysis and feedback.
- Regularly following up with financial institutions to obtain project status and to encourage things forward.
- Iteratively working with the financial institutions to resolve issues and repeat tests cases as they are required.
- Continually feeding back results and project status to the immediate team and at times wider organisation.
- Collating records of completed certifications and keeping track of expiration dates and the requirements for recertification.

## Do I have what it takes?

- Good general technical skills and understanding

- Version control in a multi-user environment (Subversion, Git, CVS ...)

As well as being a part of something exciting everyday, you will also receive the following benefits:

- 25 holiday days each year (+ bank holidays + 1 day after each year of service with up to a max. of 30 days)
- Work-life balance with our Flexi-time policy
