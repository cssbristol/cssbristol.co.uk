Citadel's started protecting ships from piracy in 2011.  We deploy armed teams  and charter security escort vessels to protect ships crew from kidnap for ransom in high risk environments.

Our business has grown into more specific security areas such including the following areas,

- Protecting a family whilst on a trip to visit a Headhunter tribe in Papua New Guinea
- Assessing business risk and providing close protection in countries such as Nigeria, Somalia and Yemen
- Providing Bodyguards to work in all environments from Paris to Libya
- Protecting Superyachts in the Indian Ocean
- Extracting civilians from states where the security environment has collapsed in Sudan

 We are hiring up to three developers to join us to build a platform for security services.  This is an opportunity to disintermediate the security market globally .  

If building something that would be like Uber for Security Vessels in Nigeria  or Airbnb for bodyguards sounds like it might be fun then get in touch and lets have a chat.

We are flexible on pretty much everything.  What we are not flexible on is bringing in great people.
