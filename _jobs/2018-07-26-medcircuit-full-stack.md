We are looking for an experienced full stack web and mobile developer with previous experience working in start-ups or similar.
The ideal candidate will have experience leading development teams as the role will evolve into this, but if the candidate can show willingness and ability to grow into this role without prior management experience they will still be considered.
As a start-up our capital is limited, we are offering a competitive starting package based on experience. We are looking for people who want to fast track their career by joining a rapidly expanding start-up which will give them the opportunity to manage development teams and entire projects in the near future. This is an opportunity to get in on the ground floor of a company that is forecasted to be global by 2020.
The candidate should be passionate about the company’s products and working within the MedTech space. An understanding that start-up culture is different to corporate culture is a must have, we are not looking for someone who wants to get the work done and go home as fast as possible every day. Sometimes the work load is more intense and requires longer hours, this is counter balanced by sometimes having a lower workload and being able to clock off earlier.
The role will be home-based for the first few months. After this the role will be based out of our office in central Manchester, however the option to work from home some of the time is open for discussion if the candidate wants to do this.

Previous experience working on healthcare software is ideal but not necessary.
