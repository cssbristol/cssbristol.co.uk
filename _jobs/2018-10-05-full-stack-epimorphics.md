Epimorphics is hiring a full stack developer to help produce interactive web applications and data visualisations using JavaScript and Ruby on Rails, and other languages.

Working at the forefront of open data publication in the UK, we help our clients manage, publish and gain insight from data in a wide range of domains, often with a positive benefit for society. We’re expanding, and are open both to practiced JavaScript / Ruby developers and to people with less experience, including new graduates, who are keen to learn.

You’ll be joining small and large projects to deliver user-facing applications with significant impact, working directly with clients ranging from government departments to NGOs to private companies. Our clients’ linked-data and semantic web datasets contain intricate relationships within large volumes of data. Users of those datasets include domain experts and the general public. You will create web applications that give them accurate data that they can understand and rely upon, as well as advancing Epimorphics' range of data publication tools and products.

We’ve built groundbreaking linked data services for the public sector here in the UK and elsewhere.

You can expect to work in small teams where you can make a significant contribution, build on your strengths, and learn new skills in a supportive environment.
