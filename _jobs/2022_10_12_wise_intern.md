## Job Description

Wise is one of the fastest growing companies in Europe. 

Current banking systems don't let us send, spend or receive money across borders easily. Or quickly. Or cheaply. 

So, we're building a new one.

We're on a mission: to make money without borders the new norm. We've got 13 million customers across the globe and we're growing. Fast.

At Wise you'll work on challenging technical problems across the full product life-cycle and you'll build great products for our customers by contributing data-driven analysis and insights.

## Job Responsibilities

- Take Wise to the next level as we scale to impact millions more customers. You'll help your team build seamless experiences for our customers
- You'll work on the core flow of Wise and help guide our customers. From their first experience on our landing page, to completing a transfer, you'll help make sure they're informed every step of the way
- Create clear and helpful interfaces, by understanding the challenges our customers may face along the way. This will be at the core of what you do
- You'll work on a real project. We can't say what project yet, but your internship will be centred around this

## Educational Requirements

- You are a penultimate year student studying a Bachelors or Masters degree. This might be in Computer Science (or any other STEM subject)
- Able to start a 10 week internship from the 26th of June 2023 until the 1st of September 2023
- You are available to start a full time graduate role in September 2024

## Experience Requirements

- A side project(s) that you are proud to present. This might be something you have self started, or a university project you are working on
Curious, keen to learn and proactive by nature

## Desired skills
- Knowledge of computer science fundamentals including data structures, algorithms and software design
-  A basic knowledge in modern web technologies and a strong interest in web development
- Familiar with any major programming languages like Java/JavaScript/Kotlin/Swift (we are more focussed on your willingness to learn new technologies)
- You thrive on being part of a team
- A positive can do attitude. You are always focussed on the solution once you understand the problem
- You are open to and value feedback in order to improve
- Motivation to become a developer with a product mindset (not just a coder)
