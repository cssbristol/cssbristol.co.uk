We have a full year of sports planned to give you a break and time to have to fun with your fellow students. We will be running a 5-aside football team throughout the year representing the Computer Science department. Details on how to participate will be provided later in the year.

In addition to this we will be hosting several themed tournaments in a variety of team sports for members of the society with prizes to be won so be sure to be sure to come along! Details of these will be released later in the year so be sure to keep an eye out.

If you have any more ideas or would like to be involved don't hesitate to send us an email at sports@cssbristol.co.uk
