# Sports

We have a full year of sports planned to give you a break and time to have to fun with your fellow students. We will be running a 5-aside football team throughout the year representing the Computer Science department. Details on how to participate will be provided later in the year.

In addition to this, we will be hosting several themed tournaments in a variety of team sports. There will be prizes, so be sure to come along! Keep an eye out for details of these later in the year.

We currently have two 5-aside teams entered in the intramural football league and various groups set up for lots of different sports.

If you have any more ideas or would like to be involved don't hesitate to [send us an email](mailto:sports@cssbristol.co.uk)!
