## THEME

- Our theme this year is SPACE! 🌌🚀

The prizes will be awarded in three categories:

1. *Satellite Intelligence*
  - Find a cool way to use satellite imagery or other data collected in space.
  - e.g. [Pollen count prediction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9M91NDIaKHo)
2. *Software and Hardware for Space*
  - Build something that we could send into space!
  - e.g. [vital signs monitor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUBIyJmGhw)
3. *Exploring Space*
  - Help non-scientists to explore and learn about space.
  - e.g. [Kid On The Moon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKcOmnVf-I)

Here are some more projects to get your brains whirring:

### NEO Mapper

Identifying natural boundaries (rivers) from 3D asteroid surface data

- [Github](https://github.com/abbro-ca/VestaRainbow)
- [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE0qdKAN31A&t=55m)

### NatEv Explorer

Display crowdsourced natural events on a 3D globe

- [More Info](https://open.nasa.gov/innovation-space/natev-explorer/)

### FractalNet

P2P wearables for communication in space

- [More Info](https://2016.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/space-station/rock-it-space-fashion-and-design/projects/fractalnet)

### Pollen Alert

Use open data and satellite imagery to predict pollen count

- [More Info](https://2017.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/our-ecological-neighborhood/trace-invaders/teams/lemon-py-1/project)

### Heliox

Use energy and solar radiation data to predict energy production

- [More Info](https://2017.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/earth-and-us/you-are-my-sunshine/teams/heliox/project)

Maybe you'll write a piece of software that will improve shipping efficiency. How about a system for monitoring air pollution? Or something that will enable autonomous vehicles? Perhaps you'll even write a cool visualisation that uses the [NASA Open Data platform](https://opensource.gsfc.nasa.gov/).

If you want to make use of satellite data, we'll be releasing some guides to help you soon.

## TOOLS

- Join our [Discord server](https://discordapp.com/invite/pt97nDh) for updates on the day!
- We'll be buying a few bits of kit for the day. [Let us know](mailto:treasurer@cssbristol.co.uk) if you have any specific requirements! We'll try our best to help.

## GOOD LUCK!
