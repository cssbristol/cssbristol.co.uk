Could you see yourself at the helm of our next Hackathon or Bar Crawl? Being a committee member is a great way to gain experience running events, dealing with industrial sponsors and communications. And to boot - it's a whole lot of fun!

### Adam Deegan

Through being the first-year rep for CSS I’ve gathered lots of experience and knowledge related to the society and want to have a greater impact on how it's run. I loved helping with events last year and want to continue the quality and volume of them, and include some more focus on mental health/wellbeing (from events like a weekly coffee shop meetup).

### Muntazim Ali

UNBAN ME FROM THE DISCORD (ps this is not a joke I am running for every role and plan to give a speech)

### Miklós Borsi

I am applying for the CSS committee because I have enormous leadership experience. I organize discussions, plan projects, distribute tasks and make everything run smoothly and on time. I've been JCR Committee, Esports officer and Social Secretary, lead of just about every group project and even a game studio of my friends and I.


I believe I can make the entire committee's lives easier and the society more efficient if elected.That was way enough bragging for now. You may ask, dear reader, what direction I would like CSS to take. You asked exactly the right question then because the answer is in the paragraph just below. Read on!

I plan to forge CSS from a society to a community. The current technical and professional side is excellently done - the tech talks, hackathons and such are great. However, the society often feels disjoint, cliqued. I believe that we could have more events not necessarily centered around computer science itself - events that let people get to know each other better. I would push for more pub quizzes, picnics, Game Jams and joint socials.

### Katie Marquand

Having been the Sports and Social Officer for the past year I believe that I have the experience and skills necessary to help run the society.  Being part of the committee last year gave me a sense of purpose and I would love the opportunity to represent CSS again and continue to improve the events and socials.  Also I'll make sure there is a football team this time.

### Kenneth Lomas

I reckon I'd be able to do this. I will work hard for the society
and keep all the papers tidy.

### Elias Kassell Raymond

"I am currently treasurer for the University of Bristol Boat Club, the club with the largest cash flow of any associated with the SU. I know most of the SU finance team, have completely remade the finance management system for my position, participated in many purchases, and would love to apply my skills and connections to CSS.

I am also Chief Technology Office for a new project, the Bristol Hedge Fund, a rapidly growing finance project aiming for mass student participation, and would like to introduce the opportunities they provide to anyone interested in a career in finance. These opportunities include talks from prominent members of banks, the use our practice trading platform, and given the skills of CSS the opportunity to help to develop our platform.

Next year I will be taking particular interest in acquiring unrestricted funds for the Boat Club, and would like to see what I could do for the CSS as well.

Pizza pizza pizza pizza pizza!"

### Roberto Lau-Soto

I would be honoured to be chosen as either events lead or as a general officer on the committee. I can bring my experience as a first year course rep with regards to listening to what people want and coordinating with others to provide a rewarding experience at uni for CompSci students. If given the role of Events lead especially I would try my hardest to secure a wide range of talks (with free pizza of course) throughout the year and help other events like hackathons, revision workshops etc. run as smoothly as possible.

### Kyle Welch

Over my time at Bristol I've worked on numerous Outreach/Widening-Participation projects and would love to bring that experience into the role as Outreach officer. One of the main goals I'd like to achieve is to make information around working on Outreach projects more accessible - possibly set up a web page with information about opportunities available. This could include work from in the department (Digimakers, etc.), but also other projects around University and the local area (like Bristol Hub).

I'm also hoping to reach out to other Computer Science Societies at Universities in the UK and organising a collaborative event (Hackathon, Coding Challenge or something else).

An event I'm also particularly keen to start up Coffee & Code (or similar). It would be a regular social where people from CS could meet up in a local coffee shop (perhaps BTP) ,  have some coffee and code. The overall aim would be to make it as inclusive as possible and to foster a greater sense of community within CSS.

Nominees will have a chance to speak for 60s (once, regardless of how many positions you apply for) during the AGM.

If you're abroad this year or can't attend the AGM - don't worry! You can still apply. We recommend recording a short video of yourself speaking so that we can play it at the AGM. If you like, we can read out a written statement instead.
