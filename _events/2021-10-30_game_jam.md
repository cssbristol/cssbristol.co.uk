Our first hybrid hackathon is coming! Team up with your friends (or go it alone, that’s fine too!) and join us on 30th October for a 24-hour GameJam, where you will compete to make the best Halloween-themed game possible (We will also assign a random subtheme to each team)! It’s a fantastic opportunity to develop your skills and maybe win a prize! Did we mention that there will be free pizza?

140 in-person limit - first come first served (other participants will be asked to participate virtually)

## Rules: 

Maximum team size: 6
* Be respectful to other teams
* No offensive imagery / text in games
* Use of third-party assets is allowed but must be declared and will not be taken into account in judging
* Follow the theme
* Completed in 24 hours
* Team can’t be more than 34% committee to be eligible for prizes

## Tentative Schedule:

### 30 October: 

* 10:00 AM to 11:00 AM - Registration + Intro Talk 
* 11:00 AM to 8:45 PM - Day 1 (You can and probably will keep working overnight, remember this is a 24 hour event!)

### 31 October: 

* 08:30 AM to 11:00 AM - Day 2 
* 11:10 AM to 12:10 PM - Presentations 
* 12:30 PM - 1:00 PM - Announce Winners!


We will be setting up a channel in our Discord server in the coming days for further communication and to help people find a group. We will also be communicating information over email.
