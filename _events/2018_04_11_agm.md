It's that time of year again! Come to the CSS AGM for free pizza and a free vote.

---

We'll be electing twelve new committee members. You can nominate yourself for multiple positions, and elections will happen in this order:

- President
- Vice-President
- Treasurer
- Secretary
- Events
- Press
- Webmaster
- Sports and Social
- Outreach
- Equality and Diversity
- General Officers (x2)

You will have a chance to speak for 60s (once, regardless of how many positions you apply for) during the AGM.

If you're abroad this year or can't attend the AGM - don't worry! You can still apply. We recommend recording a short video of yourself speaking so that we can play it at the AGM. If you like, we can read out a written statement instead.

Could you see yourself at the helm of our next Hackathon or Bar Crawl? Being a committee member is a great way to gain experience running events, dealing with industrial sponsors and communications. And to boot - it's a whole lot of fun!
