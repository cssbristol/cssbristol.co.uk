**Freshers Event**

Come and say hi to the committee at the CSS stand at the department’s pop-up event. You can learn more about what we do, how you can get involved, and receive some freebies too!

There’ll be free pizza (which, weather permitting, we'll go to the Royal Fort Gardens to enjoy) before we head over to The Brass Pig at 19:00 for welcome drinks! 

If you'd like to join us for Pizza, it would be a big help if you filled in [this form](https://forms.gle/LSbiRxeMz6JPW29X7) (https://forms.gle/LSbiRxeMz6JPW29X7) so that we know roughly how many people are coming and can make sure we have enough pizza for everyone.
