      <h1 class="event-page__title">Summer Internship - Operational Cyber Researcher at BAE Systems</h1>
      <div class="blog-post__body"><p><strong><em>Did you take part in the <a href="https://cssbristol.co.uk/events/2022-10-29-bae-ctf/">BAE Systems CTF</a>? Make sure to mention it on your application!</em></strong></p>

<p>BAE Systems Digital Intelligence is home to 4,800 digital, cyber and intelligence experts. We work collaboratively across 16 countries to collect, connect and understand complex data, so that governments, nation states, armed forces and commercial businesses can unlock digital advantage in the most demanding environments.</p>

<p><strong>BAE Systems Digital Intelligence</strong><br />
<strong>Cyber &amp; Vulnerability Research Summer Internship</strong><br />
<strong>Start date:</strong> June 2023<br />
<strong>Base location:</strong> London or Gloucester</p>

<p>Here at BAE Systems Digital Intelligence, we are committed to helping governments, organisations and society navigate digital threats and opportunities. Whether it’s leveraging data to digitally transform operations or securing organisations and nations from cyber threats, we combine our unrivalled security and engineering heritage to help our clients navigate the data-reliant digital landscape.</p>

<p>As the cyber and intelligence arm of BAE Systems, we employ over 4,800 people across 15 countries in North America, APAC, Europe and the Middle East. With our distinguished heritage, we relish the opportunity to transform digital and data practices, defence, intelligence, security and society for government agencies, law enforcement, financial services, and critical infrastructure.</p>

<p>The Summer Internship programme aims to provide an environment that supports the acquisition of knowledge and experience from industry best practices and importantly, provide roles allowing the application of that understanding through practical experience in day-to-day roles.</p>

<p>You will be part of our Future Talent Community and be assigned a Career Manager, who will support and guide you throughout your career with us. All of this is designed to complement your career development, fuel your ambition, and give depth to your training and career.</p>

<h2 id="role-profile">Role Profile</h2>
<p>You will work as a part of a project team, alongside skilled and experienced individuals who are motivated to train and coach you on the day-to-day skills required to work closely with our customers, both internal and external. You will learn the tools, techniques and approaches used by engineering professionals and apply them in a controlled environment to ensure projects are delivered on time, to quality and to budget. Engineering Interns will support their team to ensure that engineering practices are followed on all aspects of project definition and delivery.</p>

<p>We are looking for talented developers and researchers who can solve our customers’ hardest problems. Trust us; these are not the kind of problems you’ll get at a hedge fund, a Shoreditch start-up or even a Silicon Valley tech company. Our customers and the things they want to do are pretty unique. We work across a range of platforms including desktop, mobile and embedded systems and a range of languages including Python, C#, Java and C++.</p>

<p>This is an exciting role for people who love computers and technology, working in the most deeply technical part of the Cyber Security domain. Whether it’s researching new technologies or creating software that makes a difference in the real world, you’ll always be working at the cutting edge of what’s possible.

  <li>O/S - Linux, Windows, MacOS</li>
  <li>Wearables – Android, Apple, Other.</li>
</ul>

  <li>Only those with the permanent and unrestricted right to live and work in the UK can be considered for a position within BAE Systems Applied Intelligence.

By embracing technology, we can interact, collaborate and create together, even when we’re working remotely from one another. Hybrid Working allows for increased flexibility in when and where we work, helping us to balance our work and personal life more effectively, and enhance well-being.</p>

<p>Diversity and inclusion are integral to the success of BAE Systems Digital Intelligence. We are proud to have an organisational culture where employees with varying perspectives, skills, life experiences and backgrounds – the best and brightest minds – can work together to achieve excellence and realise individual and organisational potential.</p>
