If you're a student with feedback about the course then take your pick from the [course reps](#course-reps-2017-18) below - they're friendly and here to represent you.

For queries regarding job postings, CSS events or anything else, send an e-mail to the most relevant CSS committee member. We'll all be happy to help.

Course directors, tutors and other key staff contacts can be found [here](http://www.bris.ac.uk/engineering/departments/computerscience/contact/).

Perhaps you're looking for a [previous committee member](/pages/halloffame)?
