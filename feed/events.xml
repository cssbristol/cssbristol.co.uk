&lt;p&gt;Do you have what it takes to rise up and take on a role? 🤔 Yes? 😍
I thought so… go on checkout down below for all the roles with their descriptions!

&lt;p&gt;If you  can’t attend the AGM - don’t worry! You can still nominate yourself/submit a motion. 🎉
Just record a short video (~2 minutes) of your speech or send us your speech to read out!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be quick though as the deadline for applications is 16/5 at 5pm.
Don’t wanna miss an opportunity to put in an order for 40 pizzas do we? 😏&lt;/p&gt;

Understanding how these feats of collective construction are achieved could unlock a new design paradigm for human architecture. In this talk I’ll present a series of simple simulation studies of collective construction in populations of idealised artificial insects, asking: might we be able to achieve self-organising architectures that combine fine-grained structure and large-scale organisation by employing “waspmites”, artificial insects that hybridize the pheromone-mediated behaviour of termites with the stigmergic building rules of paper wasps?&lt;/p&gt;

This is a great opportunity to pick up a new skill, as well as to learn how to adapt to using potentially unfamiliar technologies in an ever-changing industry (or in other words, learn to learn).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Register using the link: &lt;a href=&quot;https://css-bristol-alexa-skills-workshop.splashthat.com&quot;&gt;https://css-bristol-alexa-skills-workshop.splashthat.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…and you will be able to choose between these 2 labs (or complete both if you like a challenge):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How to Build an Alexa Custom Skill&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How to Build an Alexa Smart Home Skill&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t worry, you won’t actually need to own an Alexa to participate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That being said, there are a few things you can do before the event to prepare:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com&quot;&gt;Open an AWS account.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Visit the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.amazon.com&quot;&gt;Amazon Developer Portal&lt;/a&gt; to create an Amazon developer account.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Download the Alexa APP using App Store or Google Play.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;For iPhone users, you won’t be able to find the APP if you are using Chinese App store account. Do use global accounts.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;For Google Play users, you will need VPN to download the APP and change country setting to anything except China and disable GPS. If the country setting and GPS location is still China, you will meet timeout error whenever you open the APP.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;If you can not download the Alexa APP due to network or account issues, you can use &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/device-farm/&quot;&gt;AWS Device Farm&lt;/a&gt; as an alternative plan and could still proceed with the lab.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Register a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com&quot;&gt; GitHub &lt;/a&gt; account (if you don’t have one already).&lt;/li&gt;

Two evolutionary biologists, John Maynard Smith and Eors Szathmary, identified eight major evolutionary transitions in the way information is stored and transmitted from one generation to the next since life on Earth began, 4 billion years ago. From the common features of these transitions, the last of which was the evolution of human society and language, they argue that two human inventions rank as major transitions too. Writing, invented five thousand years ago, brought about large-scale human societies, and computer technology is driving the current transition and the changes that it is bringing are every bit as transformative as the previous ones. Within this evolutionary framework - research in the social sciences can help us understand the impact that computer technology is having on cooperation in society. But more than just understanding the present, this approach can also point to interventions we can make to increase human agency in the digital age.&lt;/p&gt;

She is also interested in increasing public awareness of the necessity and availability of high-standard encryption techniques, which she contributes to through her role as an expert on the international board of internet standards IETF. She has been a Lecturer at the University of Bristol since November 2019, and before coming to Bristol she worked at Eindhoven University of Technology, Leiden University, and the University of Bordeaux.
